# Animal-sounds
By using this site, you can introduce your children to the sounds of different animals. Here you can find a lot of voices and noises produced by the mammals and birds as well as amphibians, reptiles and even insects. 

All sounds are divided into three categories: [african animals sounds](http://animal-sounds.net/?page=africans), [forest animals sounds](http://animal-sounds.net/?page=forest) and [farm animals sounds](http://animal-sounds.net/?page=home). 

Each category is in fact an interactive application with a colourful picture of the animals in their habitat. By clicking on any animal you will be able to hear an audio recording with its peculiar voice (or, if the creature does not produce any, its noise).

P.S. 
This repository is the source of the second version of the site, which at the very beginning of its development.
